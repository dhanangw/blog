# About The Author
John C. "Jack" Bogle was the man who popularised Index Fund investing. [Applauded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqm2Xm-9DJE) by Warren Buffet "...has probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country."  
  
# Takeaways
- It is better to buy stocks that are listed in an index fund and hold it for a long time.
    - Stocks that are listed in index funds pay a dividend to the shareholder.
    - Growth of index funds is almost always upward.
- Minimise investment transactions to avoid paying brokerage fees and taxes that will lessen the return of our investment.
- Choose an index fund that has the lowest cost ratio.
- Diversify in bonds, in case the return of the market is low.
- Most successful mutual funds returns ended up around or below the average.
- Investment advisors are overrated, their recommendations usually are the same/average. but they may give investors peace of mind.
- Other than index fund, you should also diversify your investments into bond fund
    - To keep investment volatility low.
    - To have another source of returns when index fund returns are low.
    - Bond fund varies in volatility and yield:
        - Short term: less volatile, lower return.
        - Long term: more volatile yet have higher returns.
        - Medium term: in between short term and long term.
    - Bond funds try to mimic the condition of the bond market, and are influenced by interest rates.
- ETFs
    - ETF is an index fund that is easier to trade.
    - Stock selection in ETFs is less diverse than index fund.
    - ETFs are traded frequently, and are invested short term. Making the cost is too large.
- Asset Allocation:
    - Benjamin Graham: 50% stocks 50% bonds.
        - Caveat: Graham based this recommendation on the fact that during his lifetime, stocks never went down.
    - Bogle's "set-and-forget": 60% stocks 40% bonds.
        - Balanced risk-return.
        - based on previous history of stocks and bonds return.
- Bogle's "flexible": own bonds in percentage that is the same as your age. Put the rest in bonds.
    - e.g. at 25 years old, one should own 25% in bonds and 75% in stocks.
    - while you are young, you can handle market volatility better than you're old (less urgent spending)
  

# Personal takeaway
The theories presented in this book is wonderful; simple, realistic, and makes sense, but the supporting arguments presented are based on American economy. Not sure if it's applicable in Indonesia.  
  
Theorically, investing in an Index Fund is essentially investing in the nation's economy. This would be promising if the nation's policies and business atmosphere allows companies to bloom. Business atmosphere in Indonesia, in my opinion, is still controlled by the status-quo and not as "fertile" as The US. Also, currently there are no whole market index fund in Indonesia, and the lowest expense ratio of Indonesian index fund is at 1.5% (compared to sub 1% in The US). Those two things might not make index fund investing as profitable in Indonesia.
